## GO-AUTH

This is a golang web server with authentication built in. It was created for use as a template to get a started building a web server as quickly as possible.


The design is mostly influenced by [Mat Ryer's Talk on how he builds web applications after so many years](https://pace.dev/blog/2018/05/09/how-I-write-http-services-after-eight-years.html)
